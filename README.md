# course-project-based-science-instruction-career-instruction
This course is designed to facilitate the teaching of science in adult education classrooms using a Project-Based Learning (PBL) model. This course makes the connections between science content knowledge and how adults use science in their daily lives, especially in work and career-related contexts. 

Audience: Those that will benefit the most from these courses are adult education instructors, trainers, and coordinators, particularly those in ABE, Adult Secondary Education (ASE), and STEM Career Technical Education (CTE). 

Commitment: This course will take approximately 2.5 hours to complete. You must complete all units and assessments to earn a certificate.

Objectives: By the end of the course, participants will be able to:

Better understand Project-Based Learning (PBL), including identifying characteristics of effective PBL and benefits of it in adult education;
Use online resources to guide adult learners in exploring careers in the five major STEM subgroups and identify ways that STEM workers use science in their careers; and
Describe how adult basic education (ABE) programs are using PBL in STEM areas and identify at least one topic for a PBL initiative in an ABE classroom.
This course is composed of the following:

Course Introduction
Three Units:
Using Project-Based Learning to Connect Science Instruction to Daily Life
Using Project-Based Learning to Prepare Adults for STEM Careers
Mapping Science Education to Career Paths
Course Conclusion
